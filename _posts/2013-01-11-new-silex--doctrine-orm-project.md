I've been working on a new starter skeleton to help me get going on web projects. Lately, I've been moving towards Silex. Silex is great for getting a small site up and running fast.

I have compiled and registered some of my favorite packages in this distribution, including Twig and the Doctrine 2 ORM. This is the first package I've put on [Packagist.org](http://packagist.org). You can create a functional project by running a single command from your terminal. See the project home page for more information: [https://github.com/smith981/silex-skeleton](https://github.com/smith981/silex-skeleton).
